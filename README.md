# This code is from the Allstate Kaggle Competition Machine Learning Project done in Fall 2017 as a part of a class project.  

# File 1 - MachineLearningvKD includes the Gradient Boosting model alone (R Code) 
# File 2 - MachineLearningProject_BlueTeam9 includes an ensembled model including the Gradient boosting model above and a random forest model

# Both files were worked on by Alec Brown and Kimberly Davis
